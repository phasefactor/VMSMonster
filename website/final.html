 <h2>Introduction</h2>

Monster is a text-oriented computer adventure game.  Like other traditional
adventure games such as Zork and Adventure, Monster players issue simple
commands to direct a "puppet" through an artificial world.  Players can
explore the world, pick up and make use of objects, and solve puzzles.
<p>
However, Monster is quite different from other computer adventures in two
respects:  first, Monster is a multiplayer game.  In addition to the normal
actions a player can effect on the simulated environment, players can also
interact with one another.  Player characters can fight, talk, trade items
and explore territory together.  Monster is similar in this respect to some
multiplayer games available on computer networks such as the Source and
Compuserve.
</p><p>
However, Monster allows players to do something that very few, if any, other
games allow:  the players themselves create the fantasy world as part of the
game.  Players can create objects, make locations, and set up puzzles for other
players to solve.  Game mechanisms allow players to:
</p><ul>
	<li>Create and describe new objects and locations
	</li><li>Specify how game objects function
	</li><li>Provide text descriptions for events that may happen
</li></ul>

For example, a player in Monster could create a room named "Great Hall",
provide a textual description for it (which other players would see upon
entering the rooms), and describe special features of the room (for instance,
a brass plaque on the wall).
<p>
Here's what another player who walked into the room described above would see
(lines beginning with &gt; are the player's input):
</p><pre>  &gt; look
  You're in Great Hall
  You're in the middle of a vast hall stretching out of sight to the
  east and west.  Strange shadows play across the high vaulted ceiling.
  The floor is set with smooth rectangular stones.  The walls feel slightly
  cold to the touch, and damp with condensation.  A copper plaque, slightly
  green with age, is set into one wall.

  &gt; look plaque

  The plaque looks very old and corroded.   However, you can still make out
  the writing:

  " Monster, created by Rich Skrenta, 1988.  Play at your own risk. "
</pre>
Now the creator of the rooms could add a secret passage, perhaps hidden
underneath some stones in the floor.  To do this, first the player would
describe what the stones looked like, then make a hidden exit to another
location with a special command which would activate it.  Here's what the player
would see after making these changes:
<pre>  &gt; show details
  Details here that you may inspect:
      stones
      plaque
  &gt; look stones
  The stones are rough and black, and cold to the touch.  Although the
  mortar work appears to have been expertly done, it has decayed with time.
  Many stones are cracked, and narrow spaces fracture the carefully laid
  pattern.  Some of the stones are quite loose.  You might be able to lift
  one of them with some effort.
  &gt; lift
  With great effort, you manage to lift the stone enough to fit inside.

  Once below the stone, it falls back into place, sealing out the light
  from above.  You squirm down the narrow tunnel . . .
</pre>
This example only hints at the details that actually go into the creation of a
realistic game puzzle.  To set up a rich game location, a player would have to
specify: 
<ul>
	<li>A textual description of the room, as well as separate descriptions
	  for various rooms details (in the example above, the plaque and
	  the stones are room details)
	</li><li>A description of each of the possible exits from the rooms (there
	  might be no description if the exit is hidden)
	</li><li>What happens when an object is dropped at the location (for example,
	  if a player is swimming and he drops something, the object should
	  sink) as well as a message describing what happened to the object
	</li><li>For each exit, a set of messages and parameters including:
	<ul>
		<li>the name of the exit
		</li><li>whether the exit requires a special object to pass (for
		  example, a door key or some magic object)
		</li><li>a message displayed to the player if he can't successfully
		  leave through the exit (if he doesn't have the key, for
		  instance)
		</li><li>an optional message that the player sees when he goes
		  through an exit (in the example above, the text "Once below
		  the stone, it falls back into place...." is such a message)
		</li><li>a message that players inside the room see when someone
		  leaves through the exit
		</li><li>a message that players inside the room see when another
		  player enters the room through the exit
		</li><li>miscellaneous other parameters
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>



<h2>Technical Aspects of Monster</h2>

Each player who plays the Monster game runs a separate copy of the game.  Each
individual Monster process shares a database containing all of the information
about the simulated world, including:
<ul>
	<li>Records describing all of the rooms, interconnections between rooms,
	  objects, and descriptions for the above
	</li><li>The locations of every player and object
	</li><li>A special shared file used for interprocess communication
</li></ul>

Each of the Monster database files are organized as a linear collection
of fixed-length records.  Monster uses the following files:

<pre>    roomfile:	file of records containing data on Monster locations
    namfile:	file containing names for objects, rooms and people
    descfile:	file of text description blocks (10 lines maximum)
    linefile:	file of short (one line) descriptions
    intfile:	file of various integer parameters
    objfile:	file of records containing data on Monster objects
    indexfile:	file of bitmaps for the other files; used to mark
		    free/inuse records for dynamic allocation
    eventfile:	file of records used for interprocess communication
</pre>


<h3>Record Locking</h3>

When Monster tries to access a record in one of the shared data files, it first
makes a read attempt on the record.  If the record is available (no other
Monster process is reading or writing it) VMS will lock and read the record and
return successfully.  If another process has locked the record, VMS will return
an error condition.  In this case the Monster process will wait a small random
amount of time and attempt to read the record again.  Then if the Monster
program cannot successfully read and lock the record after a certain number of
retries, it prints an error message and aborts. 
<p>
In initial versions of Monster a count was kept of how many times two processes
would "collide" when both wanted to read one record.  The random wait
dramatically reduced this hit count.
</p><p>
Monster's response time using this scheme is acceptable when the load on the VAX
is not too high.  However, it does have some drawbacks.  The first is that a
data record being read by a Monster process is locked for a short time, even if
the process has no intention of writing to it.  Also, the collide-and-wait
approach is somewhat crude considering VMS has extensive record locking
facilities which are capable not only of allowing multiple-read access to a
record but also of queueing processes desiring to write-lock a record.
Unfortunately, the use of these facilities requires special VMS priviliges not
available to ordinary users.


</p><h3>Interprocess Communication</h3>

Monster processes communicate through a shared file.  A communication from one
process to another is referred to as an event; the shared file for communication
is called the event file.  Two player processes will only need to communicate
if both players are in the same location, since actions in one room won't
affect gamers elsewhere.  However, when two or more players are in the
same location, quite a lot of events may happen:

<ul>
	<li>Notification of entry and exit -- players in the room must see when
	  other players come and go
	</li><li>Notification of various actions -- such as picking up and dropping
	  objects, taking inventory and closely examining things
	</li><li>Messages when players talk to each other in the game
	</li><li>Primary, target and third-party events for fighting -- the player
	  throwing the punch sees one thing, the person being hit another,
	  and somone else watching sees a third message.
</li></ul>

Because only player processes in the same Monster game location need to
communicate, each room has an associated event file record.  Each event file
record contains a circular list of events with a pointer to the most recent
event.  When a player enters a new room, either by moving or joining the game,
the Monster process reads the event file record for the room and makes a local
copy of the current event pointer.  At periodic intervals, the Monster process
will reread the event file record and compare its local pointer to the one in
the event file.  If they are different, other player processes have logged
events to the event record, and the Monster process will pull them off the list,
handle them, and update its own local pointer.  When a process needs to log an
event, it write-locks the event file record, writes a new event, and updates the
event file pointer. 
<p>
There are over sixty different events that a Monster process can initiate
or handle; each event can be interpreted differently according to circumstances.
For example, player A may whisper something to player B.  Suppose player C is
also in the room.  Player A's process logs an event containing the message,
the event type ("whisper") and the target of the whisper (player B) to the
event file record associated with their current location.
</p><pre>  &gt; whisper b
  &gt;&gt; Hey b, this is something I whispered to you.
</pre>

Player B's process will receive and handle the event:
<pre>  A whispers, "Hey b, this is something I whispered to you."
</pre>

Player C's process will also receive and handle the event.  Usually C will only
see A and B whispering together:

<pre>  A is whispering to B.
</pre>

However, there is a small chance that C will overhear the message:

<pre>  You overhear A whispering to B:
    "Hey b, this is something I whispered to you."
</pre>

This method of interprocess communication requires that all Monster processes
frequently read the event file to see if any events have occured.  This might
seem less efficient than another scheme possibly using VMS mailboxes or shared
memory.  Lack of sufficient VMS privileges prevented me from using shared
memory.  Mailboxes might be more efficient, especially if used with the Vax's
interrupt system.  However, several problems would be present: 

<ul>
	<li>In order to allow any process to communicate with any other,
	  full interconnection would be necessary.  In addition, since VMS
	  mailboxes only transmit data in one direction, n Monster processes
	  would require 2n mailboxes.  A scheme using mailboxes would quickly
	  exhaust process quota limits.

	</li><li>It is somewhat awkward to set up mailboxes and even more difficult
	  to inform other processes of their presence.  Once again, I believe
	  that special VMS privileges might be necessary to do this.
</li></ul>

The event file scheme of communication has proven flexible and is fast enough
when the VAX load is not high.


<h3>Maintaining a Player's Existence in the Database</h3>

When a user runs Monster, it first checks a playerlog to see if he has ever
played before.  If so, the player is restored to the state he was in when he
last played, just before issuing the QUIT command.  In the user is not found in
the playerlog, he is started out at an initial location, somewhat in the center
of the world. 
<p>
To place a player into a location, Monster scans the room record for a free
"person" slot to put the player's index into.  Once the player is part of
the room record, he will be visible to other players who are also in that
room (providing he hasn't hidden himself), and they will be able to interact
with him.
</p><p>
A dangerous situation occurs when a player process dies or becomes disconnected
for some reason.  In this case, the room record shows that a certain player is
in a location, but in fact there is no controlling Monster process for that
player.  There will be no process to handle events directed at that player.
This is a bad situation because they player is not obviously "dead" to the
other Monster programs, as interprocess communication only involves sending
an event, and does not provide for receipt acknowledgement.
</p><p>
These "zombie" players were a serious nuisance in an early version of Monster.
The Monster world appeared to be full of players, when in fact they were just
ghosts left from players typing the VAX interrupt character or becoming
disconnected from modems (Monster now inhibits the interrupt character to help
prevent the casual creation of zombies). 
</p><p>
There are two cases where a zombie game character may be detected:  when
another player suspects that a game character is not being controlled by a real
user (either from a lack of response from the game character or by checking
the VAX user list); or when the player who created the zombie character attempts
to play Monster again (only one player per account is allow to play Monster
at a time, so if a player tries to enter Monster and also appears to be
currently playing the game, either 1) two players on one account are trying
to play Monster at the same time, or 2) the player character that appears
to be currently playing Monster is really a zombie).
</p><p>
To handle the first case, when one player suspects another of being a zombie,
the player can issue the PING command.  PING sends repeated events directed at
the suspected zombie, with short pauses between the sends.  If PING does not
receive a response within a certain amount of time (currently about three
seconds) it attempts to smoothly return the zombie character to the "inactive"
(not playing) state.  This involves taking every object the player character was
holding and dropping them on the ground, updating the "time of last play" record
and modifying the playerlog to show that the player is not currently playing. 
</p><p>
In the second case, when no other player has PINGed away the zombie and the
original player (the one responsible for the zombie character) attempts to
reenter Monster, Monster will inform him: 
</p><pre>	There may have been some trouble the last time you played.
	Trying to fix it . . .
</pre>
At this point, Monster itself attempts to PING the player's character.  If
two people on the same account are trying to play Monster at the same time
the PING will be answered and Monster will not let the second player into
the game.  Otherwise, the player will enter Monster normally after a short
pause:
<pre>	All should be fixed now.

	Welcome back, Faust.  Your last play was on 13-MAY-1988 at 8:31pm.
</pre>
Even with this solution, there are still situations where trouble can arise with
zombie characters.  For example, suppose a player is on a modem playing Monster
and becomes disconnected.  Another player PINGs away the zombie character.  The
dialup player calls up the VAX again, and reconnects to his disconnected
process.  Now his Monster process still thinks the player character is alive in
the room (it has no knowledge of the disconnect) but the database shows that the
player is inactive.
<p>
If only a few events have been logged in the associated event file record, the
reconnnected Monster process will notice the fatal PING to itself (lingering in
the event file record) and will abort.  However, if many events have occured
while the process was disconnected, it will not be aware of the change to the
database. This will leave the database in an inconsistent state until the player
QUITs the game.  Fortunately, when the player quits the database will be fixed. 
</p><p>
Since this problem will eventually correct itself (when the player quits) and
because checking for this very rare situation would slow response time
considerably (Monster would have to verify its existence in the database
continuously) I decided to ignore this exception.
</p><p>
I had originally hoped for a smoother solution to the "disconnected player"
problem.  In a system where a central process drives all of the player
terminals, this is possible.  However, because control in Monster is shared
between many identical processes, the problem is much harder.


</p><h2>Reflections on the Project</h2>

<h3>How the "Installed Base" Stagnated New Development</h3>

During the development of Monster I would periodically change the records
that held the Monster database.  Once changed in the program, this would render
the existing database unusable, as the new program could no longer open the old
files.  Thus, I would have to destroy the existing world if I wanted to add
any fields to the records that comprised the shared files.
<p>
In order to provide a stable environment for players who did not want to see
their hard work making Monster rooms destroyed every time I made a change to the
structure of the database, I installed a version with a separate set of data
files than the copy I worked on for development.  Players created rooms and
tested the installed version, while I continued to develop my own copy.
Eventually, the world in the first release of Monster had about 60 rooms. 
</p><p>
About a month after installing the original Monster I replaced it with the new,
greatly enhanced version I had been working on (the executable was about 4 times
the size of the original) and started over with an empty world.  I had provided
expansion fields in the data records for the new release of Monster so I could
continue to develop the game without having to work on my own private copy. 
</p><p>
The second release of Monster was very popular.  I continued to add features to
the program, and made use of the expansion fields when possible.  However, I
felt more and more constrained by the limits of my database.  I needed to
change more about the data records than the expansion fields would allow.
I wanted to erase the world a second time; however, players had put much work
into creating over 100 rooms, and became quite angry when I suggested that I
might throw away the current world to make a new one.
</p><p>
Some suggested that I write a program which would convert the existing database
to a new format.  However, I felt that the work to do this would be much greater
than the work I was planning to spend to make enhancements to the game. Also,
the style of my changes during development called for small frequent changes. I
abandoned the idea of trying to write a translation program, and instead
attempted to work around the limitations of the database structure.  Eventually,
however, my work stagnated, and new development on Monster ceased. 
</p><p>
I never anticipated the work of my playtesters holding back further development.
If I were to rewrite Monster, I would use a more flexible storage approach, one
probably involving a form of dynamic typing which would let me add new
parameters to the database without actually changing the record structure or
size.

<h2>Appendix E:  An Actual Monster Game Log</h2>

<pre>$ monster
Welcome to Monster!  Hit return to start:

Welcome back, Faust.  Your last play was on 1-JUN-1988 at 10:47pm.

You're in Great Hall
You're in the middle of a vast hall stretching out of sight to the
east and west.  Strange shadows play across the high vaulted ceiling.
The floor is set with smooth rectangular stones.  The walls feel slightly
cold to the touch, and damp with condensation.  A copper plaque, slightly
green with age, is set into one wall.

Monster Manager is here.
&gt;
Monster Manager vanishes in a brilliant burst of multicolored light.

the writing:

    plaque
&gt; look stones
The stones are rough and black, and cold to the touch.  Although the
mortar work appears to have been expertly done, it has decayed with time.
Many stones are cracked, and narrow spaces fracture the carefully laid
pattern.  Some of the stones are quite loose.  You might be able to lift
one of them with some effort.
&gt;
Monster Manager is looking at the stones.

&gt;
Monster Manager says, "Hey Faust, let's go down to the Underhall."
&gt;
Monster Manager manages to lift a stone in the floor and descends.
&gt; lift
With great effort, you manage to lift the stone enought to fit inside.

Once below the stone, it falls back into place, sealing out the light
from above.  You squirm down the narrow tunnel . . .

You're in UnderHall
This is a cramped, humid room beneath the Great Hall.  The walls are
dripping with water condensed from mist rising from the baths.  Some
of the mist follows the ceiling and dissappears up the narrow tunnel.

Stairs lead north down to the Great Baths.
A neon sign flashes "Great PIB's Lair" over a door to the South.
You could manage a crawl through a narrow tunnel leading upwards.

Monster Manager is here.
&gt; look Monster Manager
Monster Manager is the stereotype of a computer hacker.  He is wearing
a flannel shirt with several snickers bars in the breast pocket.  On
his belt is an ASCII-HEX conversion chart.  On his feet are a scuffed
pair of hiking boots so he can tackle those dangerous mountains that
crop up in operations.  Also dangling from his belt is a battered box
with many buttons on the front and wires with sockets on the ends protruding
from the back.  The switches seem to have been placed haphazardly, but
the object is unmistakably one of great power nonetheless.

Monster Manager is in perfect health.
Monster Manager is empty handed.
&gt;

Monster Manager swings at you but misses.

You're in Great Baths
These are the luxurious Great Baths where tired adventurers may come
to relax and try to regain their health and youth from the mineral waters.
&gt;From where you stand at the entrance, you can see below you the bubbling
soapy pools of water churning violently in tile-lined pits.  The pools
are fed by hot springs from deep in the rock beneath you.  Steam and
huge soapy bubbles rise out of the hot pools of water.  The bubbles
dance through the air, climbing higher and higher, until they either
burst on the sharp walls of the cave or are lost in the mist above you.

Shallow tiled steps, wet and slick from the hot soapy waters of the
springs, lead down to the pools.

Rough stone stairs lead up to the south.

In an explosion of orange smoke Monster Vice Manager poofs into the room.

Monster Vice Manager says, "Hi, Faust."
&gt; look Monster Vice Manager
The Monster Vice Manager is dressed in a conservative three piece
suit.  The stern expression on his face is just a facade, he really
is a warm and sensitive guy underneath.  He is willing to answer
any questions and help out with any problems.  He can best be
described by the phrase:

            "Do what thou wilt, so mete it be."

He returns your gaze with a hint of understanding and amusement.
