Installation Instructions for Monster:
======================================

The Monster source code comes in three files:

	guts.pas	short.  VMS system calls and such.
	mon.pas		large.  The Monster code.
	privusers.pas   very short.  Local definitions to make Monster
			work on your system.

You should edit privusers.pas before compiling.  Put in the userid's of
people who will be the game administrators and set the ROOT variable to
point to the directory where the Monster datafiles will be kept.

This directory should have read/write access for everyone who will play
Monster.  You can either do this with SET PROT=(W:RWE) or with ACL's.

After you've got this all setup, compile Monster:

	pas guts
	pas mon
	link mon,guts
	rename mon.exe monster.exe

Now, before you let anyone else play, RUN MONSTER.
When it says "Hit return to start: "  DON'T.  Instead, this very first
time only, type "rebuild".   This will make Monster go and create all of
its special datafiles in the directory pointed to by the root variable in
privusers.pas.  After Monster is done making its files you will appear in
a very small and empty world.  Time to start creating!

We've got a pretty large Monster universe here at Northwestern.  It's about
250+ rooms, and took several months for many people to create.  I thought
about shipping the world with the game, but most of the fun of Monster is
creating your own rooms, and it would be difficult to make our Monster world
mesh with a foreign VMS system (all the room ownership would be wrong and
such).  If you have problems programming rooms post a note to GameMasters,
rec.games.programmer, or send a note here.

Let me know how you like Monster,
