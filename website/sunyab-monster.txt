You're in the Necromancer Street

  Beyond a doubt this is the most interesting section of the
Necromancer street complex.

Warring factions have littered this area with signs. Clearly
the argument lies on whether the God depicted in the Church
exists or whether the Atheist's are correct. Arguments
are depicted on signs everywhere.

To the north is king's road south.
To the south is north atheist ave..
Necromancer Street continues to both the east & west.

You're in the Necromancer Street

Cafe Mana is to the north.
To the east is east entrance.

You're at East Entrance

 You have passed through the east entrance into the Wizard City.
Here all your fantasies for power and your fears of death
may be fulfilled. Great places of learning such as the Library
of Ancients may teach you, the Wizard City Inn may house you,
numerous resteraunts may feed you, shops and stores may
provide you with all you may need, but cross not the leaders
of the Guilds that lie in the city or Death and the graveyard may
be your only reward for your stay in the city.

There is an Alley to the north.
There are more shops to the south.
To the east is west bank of river.
To the west is necromancer street.

> n

 You feel a rat crawl over and down your back as you
crawl your way northward.

You're in an Alley

 This small alley connects the major guilds and the shopping
district of the Wizard City. Beyond a doubt the only thing
more disgusting then the thought of travelling further down
this rat infested alley is the thought of being stuck here
any longer.

To the north is the guild district..
To the south is east entrance.
There is a small opening down into the Sewer System.

You're in the Guild District

You are in the Guild District, the district in which the many guilds
have their headquarters.  If you are the leader of a worthy class and
wish to have a guildhouse here, ask the mayor of the city for the
required building permits.

The Wizard's Guild is north.
The Guild District continues to the east.
King's Road is to the west.
There is a dark gateway west.

You may want to turn off Brief mode upon entering.
You're in Craftmans Guild
You have entered the guild of the craftsman.  Here many wares are
bought and sold at fair prices and just about any items can be found
in the guild.  On the far wall(as you come into the guild) are directions
and prices of items sold in this room.  Perhaps you should pick up a
snack for yourself before you venture on into the rest of the guild.
There are some merchants near the south wall who seem to be selling bottles
of some sort of alcoholic liquids.  They are unlike anything you have
ever seen.  They are bubbling and smoking in their glasses.  You see a sign
marked  Thirsty???......  but you can't make out the rest from this distance
Maybe you should go closer and see what they are selling.

To the north is a set of double doors which lead out into the guild district.
The Local Blacksmith's 621 is to the east. Buy something,support your guild.
In the Western room is Dain's Armory (the Local Armory Guild Member).

You can buy some Chicken Wings for 150.
You can buy a Steak for 40.
You can buy a Roast Beef Sandwich for 30.
You can buy a Reuben Sandwich for 20.
You can buy a Stick Of Dynamite for 125.

You wander into a strange room that has no walls...

You're at the Blue Room

You are standing in a room that glows a strange, eery blue. The
glow appears to be emanating from a strange forcefield of some
sort. You hear a low hum in the room. There are several stones
in the middle of the room that are worn smooth from excessive
use.

To the north is valley of nis.

businesslike sections of the street.

You're in the Necromancer Street

  Beyond a doubt this is the most interesting section of the
Necromancer street complex.

Warring factions have littered this area with signs. Clearly
the argument lies on whether the God depicted in the Church
exists or whether the Atheist's are correct. Arguments
are depicted on signs everywhere.
