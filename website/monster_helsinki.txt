                         Monster Helsinki V 1.04
                         -----------------------

    Monster, a multiplayer adventure game where the players create the
    world and make the rules.

    Derived from Rich Skrenta's Monster (from version 1).

    Includes programmable non-player characters (NPC) with own programming
    language - MDL (Monster Defination Language). Also rooms and objects
    can program with it (via so called hooks). NPCs are called to 'monster',
    all other MDL-objects are called to 'hook'.

Environment: VMS V4.x (MONSTER_INSTALL.COM requires V5.x)
             PASCAL 

New to version 1.03 (posted 24.11.1990):
1)  Several bugfixes (of course)
2)  New commands MONSTER/DUMP and MONSTER/BUILD (via MONSTER_DUMP.EXE)
3)  Reading of keyboard and database polling starategy have rewrote -
    should cause smaller IO-load to system (new GUTS.PAS).
4)  MDL -parser now writes offending line and points error position when 
    it detects error in MDL-program.

    This distribution includes also small database for starters (Build 
    with command MONSTER/BUILD CASTLE.DMP).

    Compilation and installation - two possibility:
1)  Compile MONSTER_E.HLP
         $ LIBRARIAN/HELP/CREATE MONSTER_E MONSTER_E
    Read installation help

    and follow help.
2)  Run installation-script
         $ @MONSTER_INSTALL
