<blockquote><i>
Trudging home from the Libes late one night, you notice a figure darting
furtively through the shadows, obviously trying not to be seen, yet your
eyes seemed to have been alerted to his presence, as if by instinct.  There's
something disturbingly peculiar about him, so you decide to follow him to see
what he's doing on campus.  He flashes across Sheridan road onto Emerson, then
takes a quick cut to the north.  Again your gaze seems to be riveted to his
form, so much so that you are hardly aware of threading your way in and out of
the Plex's courtyards, then back across Emerson again.  Why does this guy keep
doubling back on himself?  Does he know you are following??  Faster and faster
the two of you race; now you're trying not to be seen as well, either by him
or anyone else who would be wondering what sort of activities you had been 
engaged in while out on the lakefill that would cause you to be running about 
like a decapitated chicken.
<p>
You've just about caught up with him, when suddenly he rounds a corner and
stops in front of a large doorway.  Is it Willard?  You stay behind some 
bushes so that he won't notice you, and you observe him to be fumbling in his
backpack.  A couple of things fall out as he yanks his hand out, clutching a
small, tattered slip of paper.  The objects look like a large gold key and --
is that a crystal ball?!  Hastily, he scoops them back into his pack, glances
at the slip of paper, mumbles something -- and vanishes in a burst of
brilliant, multicolored light! 
</p><p>
Now you wish you'd have gone straight home: obviously you need some rest 
after concentrating so hard under those harsh fluorescent lights in Reserve.
But wait, you don't remember seeing this part of the sorority quads before. 
That doorway is NOT Willard's.  Then you notice that he dropped that slip of
paper. You decide to pick it up, since you don't know if you can find your way
back here in the daylight.  For that matter, you don't know if you can find
your way HOME.  You look at the paper, trying to decipher the scrawled words... 
</p><pre>      RUN USERD:[CON00907.DOLPHER]MONSTER
</pre>
What the --?  Guess there's only one way to find out...
